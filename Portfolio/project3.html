                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>A console-based goal tracking application built in C# that transforms personal development into an engaging game. The application uses a point system to motivate users as they set, track, and accomplish their goals, making productivity rewarding and fun.</p>

                <h3>Application Demo</h3>
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 2rem 0;">

                <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenge was implementing polymorphism effectively to handle the three different goal types. Each goal type needed to behave differently while sharing common functionality. I designed a class hierarchy with a base Goal class and derived classes for each goal type, utilizing inheritance and method overriding to achieve clean, maintainable code. This approach allowed each goal type to have its own unique behavior for recording completion and calculating points while sharing common properties and methods.</p>

                <h3>Object-Oriented Design</h3>
                <p>The application demonstrates strong object-oriented programming principles throughout its 300 lines of code. The architecture uses abstraction to define goal behaviors, encapsulation to protect data integrity, inheritance to promote code reuse, and polymorphism to enable flexible goal type handling. This design makes the codebase extensible—adding new goal types would require minimal changes to existing code.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>Built as a solo project, the application uses file I/O to serialize and deserialize goal data, ensuring user progress persists across sessions. The console interface provides clear menu-driven navigation, making it easy for users to create goals, record completions, and view their total points.</p>

                <h3>Results & Learning</h3>
                <p>This project strengthened my understanding of advanced C# concepts, particularly polymorphism and class design. It demonstrates my ability to apply object-oriented principles to solve real-world problems and create applications with clean, maintainable architectures. The gamification aspect shows creative thinking in making productivity tools more engaging.</p>
