                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Star Typer is an engaging space-themed typing game that combines fast-paced gameplay with an extensive progression system. Players type words as they fall from space, earning currency to purchase upgrades, unlock skills, and increase their combo multipliers for higher scores.</p>

                <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                <div class="tech-tags">
                    <span class="tech-tag">HTML5</span>
                    <span class="tech-tag">CSS3</span>
                    <span class="tech-tag">JavaScript ES6+</span>
                    <span class="tech-tag">Local Storage API</span>

                </div>

                <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenges were file management and the complex math behind the upgrade system. Managing save/load functionality required careful handling of data serialization and ensuring backwards compatibility as features were added. The upgrade math needed to be carefully balanced to create a satisfying progression curve - making upgrades feel impactful while maintaining long-term playability. I developed formulas for exponential scaling costs and multiplicative effects that keep the game engaging throughout extended play sessions.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>This solo project spans approximately 10,000 lines of code, built over the course of one month. The game uses vanilla JavaScript for all game logic, with careful attention to performance optimization for smooth animations. The save system leverages browser Local Storage to persist player progress, with additional export/import features for backup and transfer between devices.</p>

                <h3>Design & User Experience</h3>
                <p>The interface features a clean, space-themed design with intuitive controls. Players can type anywhere on the screen and press Enter to submit, with helpful keyboard shortcuts (Backspace to edit, Escape to clear). The responsive layout ensures the game works seamlessly across different screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Results & Learning</h3>
                <p>Star Typer demonstrates my ability to build complex, feature-rich web applications from scratch. The project strengthened my skills in game development, data persistence, mathematical modeling for game balance, and creating engaging user experiences with pure JavaScript.</p>
