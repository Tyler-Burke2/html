weird color bar where the footer is
I want everything to be visible when in full screen, meaning no scrolling needed except for in the div with the upgrades
Have only 3 upgrades: +1 dollars per right word, Increase golden cookie chance by 1%, Increase combo per right word from adding 0.1 each time to adding 0.2...
Make the confirmation screen for resetting progress not transparent.
animation with the red border should fade in and out instead of just appear and disappear in an instant.
