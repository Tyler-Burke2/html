Version 1.01

when you buy the combo upgrade when you already have the combo maxed. For example, if the highest my combo can go is 5x and I'm already at the max of 5x when buying the next upgrade, buying the upgrade automatically puts me at 6x instead of leaving me at 5x and letting me work up to it. There are still some bugs.

Version 1.02

Sprites are added
Expanded word list


-------------

Version 1.1

add sprites - regular words are asteroids, golden words are UFOs, website logo is a rocket,
A new div for one time upgrades called 'skills'
make the first skill cost $1000 and be a skill that adds sentences that if spelled all correctly give loads of money. 
make UFOs have a different word bank with harder words
create 5 different word banks so that when a user first joins the game, the words are super easy, and then you can buy skills that give harder words which would switch to a more difficult word bank, but those harder words would be worth more money. This means there should be 4 skills available for purchase, each continuously increasing in price until the final one is purchased
change the money system so that each letter gives a dollar instead of each word giving the same amount
Change the theme of the game slightly: rocketship on the right and you have to destroy the asteroids and ufos before they hit the rocket.
